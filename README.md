🎓 SoftENG2 – MoodleQuest

Gamifying Moodle for better learning engagement – A Software Engineering 2 project.

Deployed on Vercel
📌 Overview

MoodleQuest is a student-led project developed for Software Engineering 2 that aims to enhance the Moodle learning experience through interactive quests, rewards, and gamified tasks.

The app is built using v0.dev, an AI-powered UI development platform that allows developers to build and deploy web applications quickly using natural language prompts, integrated with React and TailwindCSS behind the scenes.

This repository is automatically synced with your deployed project on v0.dev, ensuring continuous integration and up-to-date versioning with every change.

⚙️ How It Works

    Create and customize your app using v0.dev, which uses AI to convert prompts into production-ready React code.

    Deploy your application directly through the v0.dev interface.

    This repository automatically receives updates from v0.dev after each deployment.

    Vercel detects changes in the repository and publishes the latest version live.
