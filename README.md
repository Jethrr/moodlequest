# MoodleQuest 🎮📚  
*A Gamified Engagement System for Asynchronous Learning*

## 📌 Overview
MoodleQuest is a gamified system designed to enhance student engagement, motivation, and progress tracking in text-based asynchronous learning environments. By integrating quests, rewards, leaderboards, and real-time analytics into Moodle, MoodleQuest transforms passive learning into a dynamic and rewarding experience for students, educators, and institutions.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Asynchronous learning offers flexibility but often suffers from poor student engagement, procrastination, and lack of motivation. Traditional LMS platforms lack features for real-time engagement insights, personalization, and gamified incentives.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution
MoodleQuest addresses these issues by:
- Integrating gamification (EXP, badges, leaderboards, virtual pets).
- Providing real-time dashboards for both students and instructors.
- Allowing custom quests and validation tasks for learning reinforcement.
- Enabling actionable analytics to guide intervention and support.

## 🎯 SMART Objectives

### Main Goals
- **Secure Authentication** using Moodle SSO with role-based access (RBAC).
- **Boost Engagement** through EXP-based gamification and badges.
- **Validate Learning** via quests, missions, and challenge-based tasks.
- **Improve Tracking** with real-time dashboards for students and teachers.

### Specific Deliverables
- Moodle API integration with secure login & profile management.
- Gamification elements: EXP, badges, streaks, leaderboards, and pets.
- Quest system: custom missions with validation and progress rewards.
- Dashboards: visual study trends, heatmaps, and engagement metrics.
